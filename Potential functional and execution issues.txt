2) Question: Detect potential functional and execution issues:

void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount) {
synchronized(from){
   synchronized(to) {
          from.debit(amount);
          to.credit(amount);         
   }
}


Answer: 
1. Deadlock Risk
The method acquires locks on two objects (from and to) in a nested synchronized block. If two threads call transfer with reversed from and to accounts, a deadlock can occur:

Thread 1 locks Account A (as from) and waits for Account B (as to).
Thread 2 locks Account B (as from) and waits for Account A (as to).

Both threads are now waiting indefinitely, causing a deadlock.

Solution:
Use a consistent locking order to prevent deadlocks. For example, always lock accounts based on their unique ID (or hash code) in ascending order:

void transfer(Account from, Account to, int amount) {
    Account first = from.hashCode() < to.hashCode() ? from : to;
    Account second = from.hashCode() < to.hashCode() ? to : from;

    synchronized (first) {
        synchronized (second) {
            from.debit(amount);
            to.credit(amount);
        }
    }
}

2. Inadequate Validation
The method does not validate the amount or check the sufficiency of the from account's balance. This could lead to:

Overdrafting the from account.

Incorrect or unexpected behavior if the amount is negative or zero.

Solution:
Add checks to ensure amount is positive and from has enough balance:

if (amount <= 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Amount must be positive");
}
if (from.getBalance() < amount) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Insufficient balance in the source account");
}

3. Lack of Error Handling

If an exception occurs during the debit or credit operation, the system might end up with inconsistent account states.

Solution:
Implement transaction rollback or ensure the system can recover from errors. For example:

try {
    from.debit(amount);
    to.credit(amount);
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception and rollback if necessary
    from.credit(amount); // Reverse the debit
    throw e;
}
